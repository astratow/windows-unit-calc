# Windows Calculation Project

This project is going to do calculation that I do on daily basis using calculator. 

I am getting size of spacer and I have to work out sizes of the pipes to go in and create Georgian or Duplex style window unit.

Playin with the button, but cannot get it working. It says hello on the
console, but nothing else...

Thanks to John Smilga JavaScript course I have got to understand where I was going wrong... Plus I changed <input> to <p>, which seem to work a lot better.
